# Contact App

Welcome to the Contact App repository!

This application was developed by Vaibhav using Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and JWT for authentication. It serves as a reference for further projects and provides basic functionalities for managing contacts.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Contact App, follow these instructions:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shanuv000/my_contacts_backend
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my_contacts_backend

   ```

3. Install the required Node.js modules:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Running the Server

To start the server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```
````

This will start the server at `http://localhost:5001`.

## Usage

Once the server is running, you can interact with the Contact App through its API endpoints. Here are some basic endpoints:

- `/api/contacts` - Retrieve all contacts
- `/api/contacts/:id` - Retrieve a specific contact by ID
- `/api/contacts` - Create a new contact
- `/api/contacts/:id` - Update an existing contact
- `/api/contacts/:id` - Delete a contact

Make sure to use appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for each operation.

## Authentication

The Contact App uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. To access protected routes, you need to include a valid JWT token in the request headers.
